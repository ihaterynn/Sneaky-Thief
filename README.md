# Sneaky Thief Game

Welcome to **Sneaky Thief Game**, a Scala-based game designed using basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game leverages the **ScalaFX** and **Java 8** libraries to create an engaging and interactive experience.

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay

In this game, players take on the role of a sharpshooter with the mission to shoot/click on the animated, moving thief while avoiding other dynamic hostages. The goal is to deplete the thief's health bar before the timer runs out.

3. **Time Challenge:** You must defeat the thief before the timer runs out, adding an exciting race against the clock.

## üé¨ Story Introduction

Before the action starts, players are introduced to the game through a short, animated dialog scene that sets the stage for the game. This scene not only introduces the storyline but also provides instructions on how to control the gameplay.
